# Checkout Order Kata

This is my implementation of the Checkout Order Kata.

This is a simple grocery store point of sale system to scan in items 
that are either weighed or sold by each item.

To run the tests, do the following:

* Install the .NET Core SDK (Preferably version 2.2)
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Change to the directory 'CheckoutOrder\CheckoutOrder'
* At the command line, type dotnet build
* Change to the directory 'CheckoutOrder\CheckoutOrderTest'
* At the command line, type dotnet build

* At the command line, type dotnet test
